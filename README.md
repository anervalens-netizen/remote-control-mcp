# Remote Control MCP

This public repository contains source code, reusable configuration examples and fictional test fixtures. Operational records, real customer/product data, credentials, private deployment configuration and production backups are maintained separately by the operator.

## Development and CI

Use the Node.js and package-manager versions specified by the CI workflow.

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm check
```

Tests use isolated temporary data. Never point CI at a production database or import real account, customer or employee data. Run application-specific regression checks before publishing changes.

## Deployment

Configure actual hosts, filesystem paths and secrets privately. Files under deploy/ are templates, not an inventory of live machines. Preserve installed application identifiers and existing databases during upgrades. Operator deployment records and rollback procedures belong outside Git.

## Contributions

Read AGENTS.md. Use a GitHub noreply author address. Keep public issues and comments limited to generic code behavior; exclude private logs, screenshots, addresses and account information. Run the public-data guard before committing.
